# fMRI Preprocessing & Visualization

This repository provides a step-by-step pipeline for preprocessing and visualizing fMRI data using Python. It is designed for a single subject and walks through the conversion, statistical processing, and visualization of brain imaging data.

## Overview

**Steps included:**
1. Convert `.1D` data to `.csv`
2. Append summary statistics (mean, std dev, lower & upper bounds)
3. Standardize voxel intensities
4. Visualize brain activity (glass brain image)
